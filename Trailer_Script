Background
Let me tell you a short story. 
A story about two individuals who did something bordering on the impossible.
They belonged to a generation whose forefathers explored the heavens and used the knowledge to build a civilization. Their forefathers built the first stone hedges on planet earth and explored the entire length of the earth.
Several eons ago, they dreamt of revolutionizing the space industry on the African continent. They wanted to build Spaceports. They wanted Africans to build and control their own satellites. They wanted to be the first Africans on the Moon. And they want to be among the first Martians. Some people call them crazy. I call them legends. Because what was once a dream became our reality. For reference this is the year 3016. And yes, time travel has been perfected!

And upholding the dream are our friends bringing us the only podcast focusing on Space development in Africa. I present to you your hosts for the XSpace Podcast, Solomon and Jemimah.
