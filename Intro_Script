‘Wondering where you are, welcome to the XSpace Podcast, a groundbreaking new podcast that celebrates Africa's vibrant journey into space exploration


With a fast growing space industry and an African space market worth over $22.64 billion by 2026, there is a need to promote, explore and build Africa’s space sector. 


And for us it begins with creating a space for dialogue (no pun intended) between relevant stakeholders, policy makers, space scientists and our dreamy space enthusiasts. This is our motivation for bringing you the XSpace podcast. 


Why The XSpace Podcast?
Unique Space Platform for Africa: A unique platform where researchers, space enthusiasts, students, young scientists come together to discuss everything to do with Space. On this show you will hear about all the exciting (missions, projects, conferences and events) taking place on the African continent. 


Opportunity to Share your Research:  Also, we seek to reduce the distance between the academic and the non-academic. This platform provides an opportunity for scientists in the African continent to share their groundbreaking research and expertise with a global audience who are eager to learn about Africa's unique perspective on space.


The XSpace Podcast Features:
This podcast would feature:
In-depth interviews with leading African space scientists, engineers, and space agency officials.
Panel discussions on cutting-edge research happening across the continent, from Astrophysics to Satellite Technology.
Stories of the people behind the scenes – the dreamers, the builders, and the changemakers shaping Africa's space future.
Lighthearted segments exploring the cultural and historical connections between Africa and the cosmos.
And a special segment where we share scholarship opportunities for students to embark on their Space/Astronomy careers.

In short, this is a community for space explorers to connect with other explorers all over the African continent with the goal of promoting space in Africa.
